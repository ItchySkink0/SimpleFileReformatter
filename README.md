# SimpleFileReformatter
A simple file formatter made for a friend

The script is made to be ran using command line arguments. the arguments would be files paths. The first argument is the input file, the one you want to format, and the second one is the output file with the formatted text. The script itself is checking for a few characters as symbols to place a new line after. If you want to change the characters where it places a new line. that can be changed in the if statement on line 17. Most people would find little use of this script, but if you have a weirdly formatted javascript file with everything consolidated to one line this should help as is. 
As a mostly useless file, there may be some use for someone so here it is.
